how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 20/20

## Self-Reflection:
I love assignments like these. I got to do what I want and not constrain myself to the limits of the assignment.
I chose Flappy Bird. I didn't really follow a tutorial. I looked up various source code examples to get my ideas, but
most of it is my work from scratch. I referenced the previous assignment for syntax help. 
### How long it took me to finish this?
This assignment took me about an afternoon of work once I decided on the game I was going to make.
